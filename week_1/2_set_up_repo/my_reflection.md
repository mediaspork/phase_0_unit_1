## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
 
To create a respository on Github, you must first login on the home page. Once there, go to the bottom right hand corner and select a green box that says create a repository. Once there, you are going to make the repository name [USERNAME].github.io. You can add whatever description you would like, but be sure to make the repository public. You are going to select the option to initialize the readme file with a MIT license. After you setup the repository on GitHub, you will now open up the GitHub application on your computer. On the left hand side you will select your GitHub username and an unsynced repository will appear. If you would like to clone it your local computer, select the cloning button on the right of the repository.
