## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

Log onto GitHub and on the right hand side of the home page, select create a new repository. Once there create a repository name. Select that your respository is public, and initialize the repository with read me. Also add an MIT license. Once that is finished you can hit the create repository button. Then select settings and under that, select features. Click the check box next to issues. Now that you have a repository on GitHub, you want to have a repository stored on your local computer. Open up the github application that is already installed on your computer. On the left hand side select your github username. In the search bar at the top start searching for github and your repository will appear. On the right hand side, select clone to commputer. Walah! You now have a repository cloned on to your computer.

* Describe what open source means

Open source software is public software that shares how it was made and allows anyone to customize the program as they see fit. The source part of open source refers to source which refers to code. By having an open source program you have access to both the source code and what the computer can understand. 

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I believe that Open Source is good for foundation programs (such as Wordpress or linux), but not for more advance programs (photoshop, word, etc). Open Source is great that it provides you access to both sides of the software, however it elimates a large opportunity for developers to be able to capitalize off of their work. If all software was open source, fewer people would want to go into development as it would be a thankless job. That being said, having general programs open source can prove to be a benefit to both consumers and developers. 

* Assess the importance of using licenses

Licenses allow others to help you by defining some basic parameters. They help set what other developers can do with the derivatives, how they can make money and share improvements. Basically, licenses grant others specific permissions for others to use your work. This makes it easier for others to contribute to a project without having to seek special permissions. It also protects whoever created it by giving them credit for the work they did. 

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

My understanding of the existance and understanding of opensource software was solidified in this challenge. I always knew that they exisited, but didn't understand that licensing that went along with it. The "aha" moment came when I finally understood why such organizations (like mozilla) exisit to advocate for open source and/or public software. I didn't have any struggles with this as it was just following directions. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
