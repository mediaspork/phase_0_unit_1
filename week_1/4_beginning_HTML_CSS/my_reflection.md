## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 

It doesn't seem like that much is possible with HTML as far as design goes. I am curious as to the history of CSS in parallel to HTML because without each other they would be independently useless.  I get that HTML is great with editing and manipulating text, but what is the purpose of the different size headers.

I know that there was some mention as to meta tags and their importance to HTML. Why is that and how do you insert meta tags?

* What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good:
Easily manipualate text
Simple
Organizational hierarchy

Bad:
Really need CSS in order to make a graphically appealing site
Difficult for beginners
Require you to interface with other languages in order to add additional functionality
Lengthy
Selectors are not as common sense as in Ruby
Seperates text and design

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I could not figure out how to link my CSS file which was in the stylesheet folder to the HTML document which was not in the stylesheet folder. It took some experimenting but I knew that I needed to find the address to that directory in order for it to link properly. I wasn't sure where to find the address to that directory, but after some quick googling I was able to figure it out.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
