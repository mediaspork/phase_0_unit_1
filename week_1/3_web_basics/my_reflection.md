## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
 
The internet is different from the world wide web. The internet actually refers to the connection between computer networks that all use the same protocols. I also didn't know that the Internet was created by the US government. 

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?

It is important to consider backwards compatability. I am not sure if you are referring to how to setup the document or understanding of how networking works. I plan on asking my accountability group about this.

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?

This is not my first that I made a webstie live, so it wasn't different from any time in the recent past. I do remember the first time I saw my web pabe live, I thought that now I could program. On a very basic level I could, but it was far from the truth. I knew a fraction of a fraction of what was out there, but I was overjoyed in the moment. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I was fairly familiar with the word wide web and internet prior to reading these articles, so I did not have any "aha" moments.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Codeacademy course on HTML (which will probably be useful on other exercieses as well).
