## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection
* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

I did not have any stuggles installing and setting up GitHub. The only thing that I wasn't aware of was that I needed to install the command line tools so that I could also use Git. Besides from that, it was as simple as installing any other program on my mac.

* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 

Git is very similar to version control which is a way for you to manage changes made to your files. You can modify or change files with out impacting the correct or foundation file and merge the changes once you are ready. GitHub is simply a hosted version of Git that allows developers to collaborate and track changes in real time. 

* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.

Version control is a tool that is used to keep track of the changes made in a file. If you make a mistake or have an unwanted outcome to some of your code, you can simply revert back to an earlier version of the file without those changes. GitHub helps to apply version control to ease multiple delopers working on the same project at the same time. This allows multiple users to not overwrite each others work as well as collaborate in real time.

* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?

As I explained in the answer above, GitHub helps with version control because it is a cloud based platform that allows developers to collaborate or "merge" files in real time while preventing them from overwriting the work of others.

* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Since Git is such a great idea, why did it take over 5 years for someone to put it on the internet?
