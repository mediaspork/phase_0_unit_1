# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

I think web standards are good because they provide basic guidelines for web developers and designers. I think that our current web standards could be a little more organized because they typically come after a new development instead of before. 

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

Yes, it makes sense to me. I understand that HTML is a markup knowledge, CSS is for design and JavaScript is for interactions. The DOM is more complicated, but I understand that it connects different languages across the web so that the HTML structure can understand and read the JavaScript and CSS. With each of these different types there are different corresponding structures that need to be understood in order for them to work together. 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

It seems pretty much the same, but I do appreciate the more specificity they provide. I can understand how they make it easier than just having a bunch of div tags with CSS classes. The biggest benefit that I see is that it increases the readability of the code which helps the organization.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

The reset.css feature allows for making web effects into basic elements. This allows you to see all the individual parts that make up the HTML.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I use Google Chrome. Yes, I do notice the difference and sometimes it can be incredibly frustrating because a website will not open in one but it will in the other. I think that it is bad that the content and design varies across browsers. I will definately keep that in mind when I start doing more development. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I needed a little more understanding in reset css so I looked at the following site:
