# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

My biggest time management challenge during Phase 0 is managing my Dev Bootcamp work with my full time job/school. I am currently finishing up high school and have to balance studying for finals and the phase 0 work. On top of that I also run my own business which requires additional time. Until June 11th, I will be running at pretty much full capacity because of these three projects. As a result of my jam packed schedule, I am forced to do my DBC work on Saturday evenings and all day Sunday. Sure I get distracted some times because I have had no break the entire week, but I always find a way to get it done.

* How will you combat that? 

Time will eventually be on my side. As I mentioned above, I am graduating from high school and in about 2 weeks I will be completely finished with all of my work related to graduating. The key to getting everything done is by creating a plan. I tend to plan on Sunday evenings what I need to accomplish each week and how I plan on accomplishing it. This strategy has worked for me for almost a year and I plan on continuing that with Dev Bootcamp. 

* What techniques will you try?

In addition to making a schedule and maintaining my calendar, I plan on following some steps of the pomodoro technique. I need to be honest with myself to how much effort and time a task will take so I can accurately plan my schedule. I need to also separate my work and "want" time so I don't get distracted until I get my work done. Basically, first things first. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My plan is to attempt to stay on track until I can devote myself full time after June 11th. Until then it will be an extreme challenge for me as I have other things going on. After I graduate I plan on immersing myself more in the coursework so I will be prepared for Dev Bootcamp. This way I can make sure that I have mastered the phase 0 coursework before I arrive in New York.
