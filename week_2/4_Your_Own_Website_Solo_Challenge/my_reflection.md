# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: mediaspork.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I had a prior background with user experience design, however I found it really interesting how the habits of the user dictate good user experience. This is what has made many websites and apps incredibly successful today. People tend to want to over complicate things, but that might not be the best solution. I found that you need to strike a balance between what is practical and visually pleasing. 

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I find design and user experience incredibly interesting. I know that it is something that I have always been interested in, but I love understanding the ideas and concepts behind the design. I knew before reading this content that people always underestimate the value of a user experience designer, but this solidified it even more. I thought that was difficult to translate my design ideas to my site either because they were overly ambitious or I wasn't technically capable.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

The first thing that I did was look for inspiration on other sites to see what I liked and what I didn't. Then I would go and wireframe my ideas while referencing others that I liked. After my wireframe was finished I would plan how I would approach the design techincally. Sometimes this was difficult as I didn't know how to approach certain challenges/aspects but it was a learning experience. 


* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I want to create a fixed width header that scrolls with the page. I also want to integrate a social element of facebook and possibly twitter. I did a little research on facebook and it seems that I need a litlle JavaScript knowledge before I can integrate this, so it might be 1-2 weeks out. Other than that I want to make the design a little more modern and clean up a few loose ends. 

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

I didn't think that it was too difficult as I always had a sense for design. The harder part for me was applying the design techincally. I found it super cool that I was finally seeing the process from start to finish. Working with many developers in the past, I finally understand what they have to do when I communicate my ideas with them. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
