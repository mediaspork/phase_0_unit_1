# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

The Document Object Model is also referred to as the DOM. The document object model organizes the elements of a web page into a tree structure which makes it easier for developers to search through and modify different aspects of the page. It is good that it allows developers to make changes quickly and easily, however the changes are not perminant which requires the user or developer to download the page and reupload it. 

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

Wordpress sites look different (in a more complex way) compared to my site. The wordpress site is more complicated because it has a backend dashboard which allows users to change the content instantly and without coding knowledge. Because of this, the wordpress site has significantly more javascript then my site.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

I thought that chrome web tools was a pain to work with for more complicated things, but it works for finding bugs or making quick changes. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

When visiting and using websites I never really thought about network optimization. I thought it was interesting and important to understand how the servers need to keep this optimization in mind.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
