##QUIZ

* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 

The elements tab supports realtime editing of HTML and CSS for editing and previewing (temporary) within the browser using DOM.

  * Javascript Debugging

The sources tab will allow you to debug the javascript. This tab displays the source code of the document and allows you to edit and save the changes.

  * Performance Optimization 

The network tab will allow you to look at performance optimization. This displays a list of specifications for each file and associated elements or files requested for download and downloaded by browser upon upload of the webpage.

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?

The quick key is control + shift + l


* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)

The color is #0b0f11.

  * Tweak the background color to white.

Done.

  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.

Done.

  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.

Done.

  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/

Done.

  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.

You can't tweak the color of the text because the text is part of the image not formatted as text in the HTML/CSS document. 


* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 
  
The largest image on the website is the share bar.

 * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.

I found this information in the Chrome Dev Tools network tab. Here you can sort the images by size by clicking the size header. After the list is sorted you can scroll to find the first image (the largest size). 

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?


885.9 KB could be reduced by optimizing the images (39%).
