# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsibe web design is when the web design is aimed at making the optimal viewing experience on any device. This means that the navigation and content viewing experience needs to be eeasy. This could require resizing from different devices. I think that it is extremely interesting and imporant. I like it because when people create responsive content, they allow others to create new devices that could tap into the web. By making a website responsive, it allows the user to see the content in a neat and organized manner, while keeping the website interesting and organic in design. 

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Smartphones and tablets created a whole new category for web design and development. Although it probably caused frustration for people who had to reoptimize their sites, it allowed them to reach a broader audience on the mobile level. Becuase of this growing category, it created a whole new specification set for web design. This forces designers and developers to keep this group of users in mind when they build a website. I think that smartphones and tablets are just the beginning and over time we will see even more smart objects that will continually change the web requirements.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

Although visually impaired people can't use the web like we do, they do make certain reading devices that allow them to read the screen using braille. This device translates the text to braille so the visually impaired person can understand it like any other text. Unfortunately I don't think that we should design and develop around them because it is a small subset of people that are visually impaired. The larger group of people who are slightly visually impared (in the sense that they have a hard time seeing but are still able to see) we can cater to them by making things simple and easy to read and understand.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Making static websites doesn't really make sense to me after reading and learning about responsive websites. Also using Google's Dev Tools can be really helpful in understanding problems or playing around with the HTML/CSS on a website. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
